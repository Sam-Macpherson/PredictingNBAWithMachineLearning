%%%%%%%%% Introduction %%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

The {\it Introduction} section describes the background and motivation behind your work.   This section should describe the problem that your project is addressing.  Why is this an important problem to tackle?   Consider using stories, statistics, and facts to really motivate this work.  What are the potential real-world impact, if your project is successful? 

The length of this section is typically 1/2 to 1 page.

%%%%%%%%% Summary of your contributions %%%%%%%%%

\section{Contributions}

The {\it Contributions} sectinon should answer the following questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the specific research question you are addressing?
    \item What are the methodologies you are using to answer the research question? 
    \item What do you anticipate the results to look like? 
\end{itemize}

The length of this section is typically around 1/2 page.

%%%%%%%%% Related Work %%%%%%%%%

\section{Related Work}

The {\it Related Work} section should cite and summarize 3-5 papers related to the problem you are tackling.   

Here are some examples of citations: \cite{russell2016artificial,gao2016incentivizing,gao2014trick}.  

It is not sufficient to summarize each prior work independently.  You need to describe a coherent story that incorporates all of these prior work together.  Compare and contrast them.  Try to describe a story of how researchers have explored the topic in the past and what progress they have made so far.  

Explain how your work is going to build on these prior work, i.e. how your work is similar to or different from the techniques that have been used.  

The length of this section is typically 1/2 to 1 page.

%%%%%%%%% Methodology %%%%%%%%%

\section{Methodology}

The {\bf Methodology} section describes how you plan to tackle the problem.  What technique(s) do you plan on using?   Which algorithm(s) do you plan to implement?  How do you plan to evaluate your algorithms/techniques?

The length of this section is typically 1 to 1.5 pages.

\subsection{Evaluation Method}

If you are using an existing data set, describe the data set you are using.  Why did you choose this data set?  What existing results are known about this data set?  Do you plan to pre-process the data in anyway? 

If you are creating data yourself, how do you plan on creating the data?  Why is it reasonable to create the data this way?  

If you are using an existing program or building a new program to evaluate your algorithm, describe the elements of the program.  Why is this a reasonable way to evaluate your algorithms?  Are you going to modify the existing program in anyway?  

Briefly describe the timeline for how you plan to find/create the data-set/program to evaluate your algorithms. 

\subsection{Algorithms}

Describe the algorithms you plan to implement/use.  Explain why the chosen algorithms are appropriate for answering the research question that you proposed.  

If you are using an existing implementation, describe why it is appropriate to use this implementation.  Describe what additional implementation you need to do to answer your research question.

Briefly. describe the timeline for how you plan to complete your implementation, for example, which group member is going to spend how much time to complete which component of the implementation.

%%%%%%%%% Results %%%%%%%%%

\section{Results}

In one paragraph, describe what you anticipate the result to be. 

Feel free to copy and paste your answer from your topic request here.
